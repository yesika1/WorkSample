    "## Project: Credit Card Application Approvals using Python\n",
    "This notebook contains a credit card approval predictor for commercial banks using machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "<p>For this project, the dataset  was extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval\">Credit Card Approval dataset</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains data for 690 customers that applied for credit with a retail bank. There are 16 attributes captured for each customer; including a decision flag which allows you to identify those customers which were approved and denied for credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The analysis of this project consist on the creation of a model to evaluate the decision to approve or deny credit card applications. The final model created is a logarithmic regression model. This model was able to predict the outcome of a credit applications with 84% accuracy which was significantly better performance than the baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a conclusion, there are four drivers that possitively affect the approval decision, as these factors increase, so does the probability that a credit card will be issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications can get rejected for many reasons, including, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, among others. The four influencing factors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior default,\n",
    "Years employed,\n",
    "Credit score, and\n",
    "Income level.\n",
    "Other variables such as age, sex, or ethnicity did not have an influence on whether the application was denied. A Chi Squared test for independence validated our conclusion Ethnicity and Approval status are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook' structure\n",
    "<ul>The structure of this notebook is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>First, loading and viewing the dataset.</li>\n",
    "<li>Second, preprocessing the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.</li>\n",
    "<li>Third, doing some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.</li>\n",
    "<li>Finally, we will build a machine learning model using Logistic Regression that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.</li>"
