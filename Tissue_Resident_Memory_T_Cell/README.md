# Tissue Resident Memory Cell Crispr Screen


The following project aims to determine critical genes for the formation of tissue-resident memory T cells against tumors.

* For this project, the dataset to determine the genes for the targeted guide RNA library was extracted from published gene arrays or RNASeq data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus.

* The solution includes files and code in Python.
