# WorkSample

## Analytics Data challenge project


The following work sample contains my solution for a data analysis challenge using Machine Learning Techniques.

* The data set for this challenge is simulated and so there is not a data dictionary (the project is more of a numerical / coding exercise).

* The challenge consisted of using the methodology of your choice fit a model that predicts `var0` using the remaining columns from the data set.

* The solution includes the final report, files, and code in R.

* The Report combines the performance of the model selected and a comparison with other models developed using metrics such as AUC, misclassification rate, among others.


## Credit Card Applications


The following work sample contains a credit card approval predictor for commercial banks using machine learning techniques.  

* For this project, the dataset was extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository Credit Card Approval dataset.

* The solution includes the final report, files and code in R and Python.

* The Report combines the performance of the model selected and a comparison with other models developed using metrics such as AUC, misclassification rate, among others.
