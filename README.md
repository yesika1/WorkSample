# WorkSample

## Tissue Resident Memory Cell Crispr Screen


The following project aims to determine critical genes for the formation of tissue-resident memory T cells against tumors.

* For this project, the dataset to determine the genes for the targeted guide RNA library was extracted from published gene arrays or RNASeq data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus.

* The solution includes files and code in Python.

## Analytics Data challenge project


The following work sample contains my solution for a data analysis challenge using Machine Learning Techniques.

* The data set for this challenge is simulated and so there is not a data dictionary (the project is more of a numerical / coding exercise).

* The challenge consisted of using the methodology of your choice fit a model that predicts `var0` using the remaining columns from the data set.

* The solution includes the final report, files, and code in R.

* The Report combines the performance of the model selected and a comparison with other models developed using metrics such as AUC, misclassification rate, among others.


## Credit Card Applications


The following work sample contains a credit card approval predictor for commercial banks using machine learning techniques.  

* For this project, the dataset was extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository Credit Card Approval dataset.

* The solution includes the final report, files and code in R and Python.

* The Report combines the performance of the model selected and a comparison with other models developed using metrics such as AUC, misclassification rate, among others.



## Text Processing: Word Frequency in Les Misérables

The following project consists on identify and visualize the word frequency distribution using Natural language processing tools to work with unstructured text data.

* First, scraping the novel Les Misérables from the website Gutenberg.org using the request package.

* Second, extracting text from this web data using BeautifulSoup.

* Third, extracting tokens/words and clean data: removing inwanted characters, transforming tokens into lowercase and excluding stop words.

* Finally, analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk).


## Predicting Customer Churn in Python

The following project consists on identify and quantifies the number of customers who have unsubscribed or canceled their service contract.
We use the available dataset on IBMs retention programs from Kaggle: Telcom Customer Churn Dataset

* First, Load and explore the dataset

* Second, we preprocessed data: handling missing values, dropping irrelevant data, transforming data type (label encoding)

* Finally, we generated a Logistic Regression model to find the key drivers on customer churning.


### Conclusions
* According with the findings of the Logistic Regression model that has an 80% accuracy, we noticed that the following features are the strongest key drivers:

- Features that having then increase the probability of a customer to churn are PaperlessBilling and SeniorCitizen.

- Features that having then decrease the probability of a customer to churn are Contract,PhoneService, TechSupport, OnlineSecurity, and Dependents
